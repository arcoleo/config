# The ultimate order is 
# .zshenv → [.zprofile if login] → [.zshrc if interactive] → [.zlogin if login] → [.zlogout sometimes]

# Since .zshenv is always sourced, it often contains exported variables that should be available to other programs. 
# For example, $PATH, $EDITOR, and $PAGER are often set in .zshenv. Also, you can set $ZDOTDIR in .zshenv to specify 
# an alternative location for the rest of your zsh configuration.

# .zprofile is basically the same as .zlogin except that it's sourced before .zshrc while .zlogin is sourced after 
# .zshrc. According to the zsh documentation, ".zprofile is meant as an alternative to .zlogin for ksh fans; the two 
# are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired."

# .zshrc is for interactive shell configuration. You set options for the interactive shell there with the setopt and 
# unsetopt commands. You can also load shell modules, set your history options, change your prompt, set up zle and 
# completion, et cetera. You also set any variables that are only used in the interactive shell (e.g. $LS_COLORS).

# .zlogin is sourced on the start of a login shell but after .zshrc if the shell is also interactive. This file is 
# often used to start X using startx. Some systems start X on boot, so this file is not always very useful.
